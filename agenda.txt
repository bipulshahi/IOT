1. Introduce IOT
2. What are requirements ?
3. Start with one selected hardware i.e NOdE MCU
4. Startb using some sensors - Temp, Ultrasonic 
5. Learn how to update server with sensor readings
6. Read the server data
7. Controlling

1. Digital Inputs   digitalRead()
2. Digital Outputs  digitalWrite()
3. Serial Inputs
4. Serial Outputs   serial.println()
5. Analog Inputs
6. Analog outputs  analogWrite()

1. IR sensor - Infrared sensor
2. Digital Switch 

WAP for digital input and analog output.
i.e. By default LED will glow at its maximum
intensity and as the switch pressed it will 
start dimming slowly

swich pressed - digitalRead - High -
	analogWrite - 255-0

switch not pressed - digitaRead - LOW -
	analogWrite - 255
